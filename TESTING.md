Those errors were really frustrating as in the walkthrough project we exactly learned how to put li elements inside a nav element. A quick fix has been deployed to save the project from having errors. Unfortunately, the time left to submit the project did not allow a complete restructuration of the base.html file. Therefore the layout is not as good as expected. It was definitely a valuable lesson to run some testing already in the early development phase.

Those errors were coming from the summernote widget used to create the blogs so to fix them, I had to manually modify the source code generated by the summernote widget. It fixed the issue but it is not a sustainable solution as it would need to be done for every new blog post created.

### JavaScript

Most of the javascript have been written within the template files because it was very short.

The javascript file is stripe_elements.js in the checkout app. The result of JSHint for that file is shown below:

![JSHint results](documentation/jshint_results_for_stripe_element.png)

- One undefined variable: stripe

    Stripe has been integrated to the base.hmtl template of the project as Stripe recommend it in their documentation. Therefore there is no need to explicitly import it in the script.js file.
![Stripe documentation](documentation/stripe_script_element.png)

### Python

Every Python file has been ran through the [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) and for all of them the result was:
> All clear, no errors found

The flake8 module has been use on the project too to detect errors. Most of them have been fix.
The remaining ones are listed below:

## Bugs

</div>

Header too bright ![bug status](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=fixed&message=No&color=bb0000&style=plastic)

The website does not display well. It looks like the main header is brighter than the viewport. Then it creates a white band on the right of the screen which is not nice. I could not implement a fix for this issue. I could only fix it with the developer tool by removing some negative margin on a nav-link element. But I did not manage to do it within my code.

Unique slug exception not handled ![bug status](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=fixed&message=No&color=bb0000&style=plastic)

Submitting an add blog post form with a title matching exactly a title of another blog post redirect to an "error 500 - internal server error". This is due to the unique slug constraint on blog posts. The good thing is that it does not create a second blog post with the same slug or title. The bad thing is that it is really not user friendly and also really not explicit so the superuser creating the blog post might not understand what to do to solve the problem.

Webhook not working - phase 1 ![bug status](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=fixed&message=Yes&color=success&style=plastic)

I have struggled a lot while implementing the checkout process and especially to have the webhook working. After so much troubleshooting, I lost hope to solve it by myself and ask the tutoring to help me. That was definitely the right decision. It appeared that I named the payment_intent_payment_failed function a certain name and I missed name the function when calling it.

Webhook not working - phase 2 ![bug status](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=fixed&message=Yes&color=success&style=plastic)

The solution above was a good start but did not solve the issue on its own. Still with the help of tutoring, we find out that my email templates for the email confirmation were in the checkout app folder instead of being in the template folder of the same app. That fixed the problem and made up my mind to carry on through the hard time.

JS file from MailChimp does not load (error 404) ![bug status](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=fixed&message=Yes&color=success&style=plastic)

For some reasons, the file (//s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.mailchimp.com/js/mc-validate.js) from MailChimp for the newsletter fail to load. I looked for a solution on the internet but I did not find anything relevant. Only one solution I found was to copy the content of that link and add it to a javascript file on the project. I have noticed that the url started with // so I the https: in front of it to fix the problem.
